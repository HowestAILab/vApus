\section{Why?}
Why is a fairly good question. Why a second version? Well, it was time for a fresh start, erasing all made mistakes in the past by me and my predecessors.
vApus v1 has its issues, it is bloated, not dynamic (adding new stresstests or new anything for that matter is a pain) and usability is lacking for the user and the developer.
 All this will be explained in the following sections, these will describe how to use vApus v2 and how it was built. That way it is a guide for both future developers and researchers.
Sections particularly interesting for developers are indicated with a {\bf(D)} in the title, for developers and  researchers both with a {\bf(DR)}.
