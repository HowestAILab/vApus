	The vApus stress testing framework is mostly build for testing web services while mimicking real users (a user browses to the homepage, logs in,...).<br />
	Because vApus is a framework it is possible to test any application that has a server socket (in theory) e.g. MySQL, Elasticsearch, ...<br />
																																		   <br />
	Stress testing is more complex than just pressing the <i>Go</i> button. Therefore some documentation is in place, listed below.<br />
	For specific questions, you can try to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@sizingservers.be" target="_top">info@sizingservers.be</a>. Keep in mind that support is not guaranteed, since active development is halted.<br />
	<br />
	In the help folder (<b><a href="." target="_blank">click here</a></b>): 
	<ul>
		<li><b>vApus stress testing intro 201802</b> gives a good basic overview about how to stress test with vApus and analyze the restults.</li>
		<li><b>README</b> contains a technical overview of the vApus source code.</li>
        <li>An example <b>version.ini</b>: a version .ini is generated using a Jenkins build job using history.xml in the sources and listing file hashes for version control.</li>
        <li><b>Jenkins 2.88 build jobs</b> for vApus, monitors and others, but only stable git branches, to illustrate how Sizing Servers implemented continuous integration</li>
        <li>Sizing Servers Lab <b>builds</b> for the last stable vApus (and tools) + monitors.</li>
	</ul><br />

    Furthermore, you can do anything you like with the software in respect to the <a href="../license.txt">MIT license</a>.
